# Appends tactics-puzzle units to content/courses/chess.json from the Lichess
# puzzle database (CC0, https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles).
#
# Only one-move puzzles: Lichess stores the position BEFORE the opponent's
# move, so Moves[0] is applied here and Moves[1] is the answer. Each puzzle is
# a `chess` exercise: a FEN to draw, and four moves in SAN to pick from.
# Distractors are legal moves (checks and captures first, so they look
# plausible) and never also mate, since Lichess accepts any mate in one.
#
# The 307MB database is streamed and never written to disk; reading stops as
# soon as every theme bucket is full.
