Language sentences come from the [Tatoeba Project](https://tatoeba.org) (CC-BY 2.0 FR), ranked by [FrequencyWords](https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords) (MIT).
Courses Cruise has played (Greek, Polish, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, French and more) get up to 120 units, sized to how much it practised and ordered so sentences using the words it practised come first. Only the word list is read from Cruise; every sentence is Tatoeba.
Chess has 195 tactics puzzles on a real board, from the [Lichess puzzle database](https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles) (CC0). Each one is replayed with python-chess before it ships.
